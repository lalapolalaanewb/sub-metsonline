"# Yii2 Project on METSOnline. Focused on Visualization of Data using Highcharts JS" 
Manuever yourself to folder, controller->VisualizeController starting on line 1444 till 3419 where my php codes lies.	
The html code would be in visualize folder.	
The javascript code would be in folder, web -> js -> {exporting.js, highcharts.js, visualizecountrycharts.js, visualizeyearcharts.js}	
That's all.	
This project been given to me to complete only the visualization part of the system.
